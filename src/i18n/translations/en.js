                'By applying technology the right way, the founder’s own business broke through its old ceiling and opened up a new path to growth. That success became living proof that technology does not merely support a business, it reshapes its future. Built on that hands-on foundation, the core team came together to found Nextgency, with a mission to bring proven technology solutions to other businesses – helping them not only solve today’s problems but also build a long-term competitive edge.'
